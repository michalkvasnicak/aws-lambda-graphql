 * Array PubSub works as local PubSub that is already fed with all the events that were published

 * Each time you call asyncIterator it will create an iterator that iterates over events
 *
 * This PubSub instance is used internally in event processor to simulate
 * source of events. Basically it acts as you were publishing events,
 * which were loaded from event store.
 *
 * If event payload is string, then it's parsed from JSON, otherwise it's used
 * as is and sent to your GraphQL schema.
